      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">I visited in December 2018</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <hr>

      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was built in 1982</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.

      <p>Students from different grades gathered to share their opinions on the matter. Some argued that stricter regulations were needed to curb pollution, emphasizing the importance of preserving our planet for future generations. Others believed that individual actions, like reducing plastic use and conserving energy, were the keys to tackling the issue. It got pretty intense, with everyone trying to outdo each other with statistics and facts. In the end, it was a great opportunity for students to learn about the importance of environmental conservation, but man, it sure sparked some passionate arguments!</p>
